# Learning Tauri

This implementation follows the steps documented in the [Tauri Quick Start Guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/).

Specifically, it sets up a new [Next.js application](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/next-js).

### Setup

Install dependencies and start in dev mode:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
First run will take a while as Cargo needs to download rust packages. Subsequent runs should be interactive much 
faster.
